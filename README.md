Solutions to the Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/archives

I give the time and space complexity of each solution. Most of the problems have specific numbers to solve for (e.g. "number of prime factors under 1000" as opposed to "number of prime factors under n"). My time and space complexity does not account for this specificity so in reality most algorthims I write are just O(1) as there are no variables. As such, the complexities I give are not well defined but the purpose is for me to solve fun math problems not practice big O, so don't worry about it :)
